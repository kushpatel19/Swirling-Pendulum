# Swirling-Pendulum

The swirling pendulum is a two-link, two degree-of-freedom mechanism which is under-actuated and has an unusual non-planar coupling with axis of rotation of the two links being perpendicular to each other. The swirling pendulum mechanism, while being simple to mathematically represent and easy to physically construct, exhibits several properties like loss of inertial coupling, loss of relative degree, multiple stable and unstable equilibrium points. These properties are unique as well as interesting from dynamics and controls point of view which make the swirling pendulum an excellent test-bed for testing various ideas in control and demonstrating several notions associated with systems and control theory.

As being part of this research project, I have performed ILC(Iterative learning Control) on Swirling pendulum, stability analysis, tracking phenomena, control of the system and modeling-equilibrium point analysis.

I have developed a control from one equilibrium position to another equilibrium position followed by Minimum Jerk Trajectory(MJT) on hardware and Simulink(Software). I have learnt the functionality of BLDC Motor, encoders, Odrive(micro controller), PID controller using Anaconda, Mechanics Explorer, MATLAB and Simulink.
